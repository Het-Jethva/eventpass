# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside this working copy.

## Wayfinding operations

- A map is a single issue labeled `wayfinder:map`, with child issues as tickets.
- Link children using GitHub sub-issues when available; otherwise use a task list and `Part of #<map>`.
- Use native issue dependencies when available, falling back to a `Blocked by:` line.
- A claim assigns the issue to the driving developer.
- Resolving a child records the answer, closes the issue, and adds a context pointer to the map.
